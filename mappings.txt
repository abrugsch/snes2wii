----------------------
--- Operating mode ---
----------------------

The operating mode can be forced to NES mode by holding the start
button down at power-up. (When you turn on your console or when you
connect the adapter to an already running console).

When NES mode is forced on with an SNES controller, the A-B buttons
become B and Y. NES games are almost unplayable with an SNES 
controller unless running in this mode. See mapping below for
details.

If a NES controller is used, the A and B buttons can also be
swapped by holding A and B down at power up.

-------------------------
---- Button mapping: ----
-------------------------

Snes style common ground controller:
- Start -> PC4 -> Gamecube Start
- Select -> PC5 -> Gamecube Z
-Left,Right,Up,Down -> Gamecube Left,Right,Up,Down
  + Up -> PC3
  + Down -> PC2
  + Left -> PC1
  + Right -> PC0
- Y -> PC6 -> Gamecube Y
- X -> PD6 -> Gamecube X
- B -> PC7 -> Gamecube B
- A -> PD7 -> Gamecube A
- L -> PD5 -> Gamecube L
- R -> PD4 -> Gamecube R

Notice the only peculiarity is that the Snes SELECT button is 
mapped to the Gamecube's Z button. There's no select button on a
gamecube controller...


---------------------------
--- Button combinations ---
---------------------------

Here are special button combinations which sends
button presses or analog axes events that are normally 
impossible on a regular NES or SNES controller due to the
lower number of buttons and missing analogic sticks. These
combinations are useful to get back to emulator menus.

Snes mode:
	- L+R+Select+left	-> Cstick right

Nes mode:
	- A+B+Select+left	-> Cstick right
	- A+B+Select+up		-> L+R
